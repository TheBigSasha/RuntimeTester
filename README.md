# Java Library to plot the Time Complexity of methods!
### Download the latest .jar from the "Releases"

## üìö Library Installation
Add the latest .jar from the releases as a library to your Java IDE:

### IntelliJ IDEA
Click on: File -> Project Structure -> Project Settings -> Libraries -> + -> Java -> (navigate to and select RuntimeTester.jar)

### Eclipse
Right click on your project -> Build Path -> Libraries -> Classpath -> Add External JARs... -> (navigate to and select RuntimeTester.jar)

## üíª Usage
### üöÄ Launching the GUI
To launch the GUI with the default demos,
```java
import RuntimeTester.*
public class MyClass{
  public static void main(String args[]){
      MainWindow.launchGrapher(MyClass.getClass());   //the class passed to launchGrapher() is the class which it gets extra test methods from.
  }
}
```
### üß† Adding your own method
To add your own test methods, use the @benchmark() annotation, as below:
```java
@benchmark(name = "hello world")                      //The @benchmark annotation has a required property "name", all others are optional
public static long testMethod(long input){            //All benchmark methods must be public, take long, return long
    //My-code-here
}
```
**Every custom test method must:**
  be _public_ so it can be called by the library
  be _static_ so that it can be called without instantiation
  _return long_ so that it can be plotted on the y axis
  _take long as the only parameter_ so it can be plotted on the x axis
  
 Here is a sample method which plots the curve of n^2
 ```java
    @benchmark(name = "sort", expectedEfficiency = "o(n^2)", category = "Math demos", theoretical = true)
    public static long nSquared(long size) {                 //There is no restriction on method name
        return Math.round(Math.pow(size , 2));        //The x axis plots size and the y axis plots what is returned
    }
 ```

### üèéÔ∏è Benchmarking real methods
Use the long parameter to indicate the number of items in your data structure

Here is a demo testing Java's built in sorting algorithm

 ```java
    @benchmark(name = "ArrayList.sort", expectedEfficiency = "O(n log(n))", category = "Java Builtin")
    public static long arraysSort(long size) {
        ArrayList<Date> dataset = new ArrayList<>();
        for (long i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            dataset.add(nextDate());              //nextDate() is a method which randonly generates dates
                                                  //as Date objects in Java
        }
        long startTime = System.nanoTime();       //This indicates when the timer on the method starts
        dataset.sort(Date::compareTo);
        long endTime = System.nanoTime();         //This indicates where the timer on the method ends
        return endTime - startTime;
    }
```

The general practice is:

  _Fill your dataset with N items
  store a startTime with System.nanoTime();
  Run your method
  store an endTime with System.nanoTime();
  return endTime - startTime_
